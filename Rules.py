CARD VALUES:
An Ace counts as 11.
The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.

THE GAME:
The aim of the game is to collect cards that equal close to 21 without going over, if you go over you are 
\'Bust\' which means you automatically lose that round no matter your card value.
You will be playing against the dealer for who can get closest to 21, You and the dealer will start with two cards each.
You will then be asked if you would like to hit (collect another card) or stick (stick with your cards and dont collect)
The player with the closest value to 21 without going over wins that round!!

BETTING:
To win the game you must bet chips and win multiple rounds of Blackjack until you reach a total of 300 chips.
For example if I have 100 chips and I place a 10 chip bet and win that round. I would have 110 chips. If I were to lose
the round I would have 90 chips. Note if you and the dealer draw your chips wont change.
